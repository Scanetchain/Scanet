# Introduction

## NEM based Commercialized AR Blockchain

Scanetchain is The First AR Dapp based on NEM platform
Developed for Blockchain Commercialization. <br /> <br/>

Using AR technology, Scanetchain digitally identifies all
products, brands, and images around us both online and offline. By assigning a
scannable marker to each object, users can scan items of physical objects with
their smartphone camera without additional equipment or requirements and
instantly access the paired Blockchain-based online platform. <br /> <br />

AR contents are provided to the users using data streaming
methods based on the cloud server. It is a technology that offers content
streaming from the AR App like YouTube. AR Streaming allows fast processing
itself. Also, it utilizes the AR camera module which is developed to work with
AR streamed data. This Technology enables quicker and more precise AR scan of
markers and allows recognition of 3D objects as well as specific images. <br /> <br />

Scanetchain is a Hybrid-blockchain composed of On-chain and
Off-chain. <br />
As a blockchain designed for commercialization, It sustains
both advantages of the blockchain and existing systems.
